<ul>
  <li>to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</li>
  <li>in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</li>
  <li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); </li>

<p>Security Policy<br />
  VI and its suppliers have a management and corporate commitment to information security within our organisations and provide clear direction, guidance and responsibilities and procedures in this respect. Our Security Policy refers to both our measures and those undertaken by our suppliers as relevant. </p>
<p>We have a compliance officer who deals with security of information and personal data. </p>
<p>All employees are briefed on the importance of personal data and security and confidentiality of information obtained. </p>
<p>We control physical security in relation to the information and personal data that is contained at our facilities and restrict access to the Website, buildings, computer rooms, office desk, technology areas, equipment and other facilities where unauthorised access by people could compromise our security. </p>
<p>All proprietary or confidential information, including personal data, is contained or stored on computer and any that is contained and stored on manual files are locked up and secure. </p>
<p>We seek to control access to information and personal data, including existing procedures for authorising and authenticating Members as well as software controls for restricting access and techniques for protecting data such as encryption. Encryption is used in connection with our payment facilities for Members. </p>
<p>We monitor and log access so as to assist in detection and investigation of security breaches and any attempted breaches where they occur. </p>
<p>We maintain a business continuity plan as a contingency plan, which identifies our business functions, and assets (including personal data), which would need to be maintained in the event of disaster and set out the procedures for protecting and restoring them if necessary. </p>
<p>Our staff is trained on security systems and we have relevant procedures in place in relation to the obligations under the Act. Accordingly, staff are aware of information security issues and they can go to the compliance officer with any issues relating to the Act, privacy or personal data. From time to time we endeavour to provide external trainers to deliver training seminars on the relevant subject. </p>
<p>In respect of detection and investigation of breaches where they occur, we have in place relevant controls, which should alert us to a breach in security. We endeavour to investigate every breach of security. </p>
<p>The personal data and information held by us are currently stored on our systems, servers, databases and back-up servers. </p>
<p>We are taking and will endeavour to continue to take all reasonable steps in order to protect our information and all personal data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information or data disclosed to us or collected by us. </p>
<p>Your Rights <br />
  You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at: contact@vizoneinternational.com </p>
<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. </p>
