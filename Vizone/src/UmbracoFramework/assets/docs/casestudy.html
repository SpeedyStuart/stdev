<h2>Alaska Programme Healthcheck</h2>

<h3>Vodafone Case Study</h3>

<p>Vodafone made the UK’s first mobile call on the 1st January 1985. Today Vodafone is the world’s leading international mobile telecommunications group with equity interests in 27 countries across 5 continents, 186.8 million proportionate customers and around 33 partner networks.</p>

<p>In May 2008 Vodafone and Alcatel-Lucent entered into an outsourcing agreement to transition three of Vodafone’s proprietary legacy systems to Alcatel’s commercial off the shelf solutions.</p>

<p><strong>The programme was to be conducted in two transition steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Transfer legacy platforms, support services and associated staff to ALU</li>
<li>Migrate legacy platforms to ALU solutions in a phased approach</li>
</ol>


<p>The first of these transition steps (Transfer of the legacy platforms) was successfully completed in 2008. The second step (Migration to ALU solutions) was underway, but experiencing operational issues and delays.</p>

<p>At the end of November 2009 the programme sponsors, Jeni Mundy (CTO Vodafone UK) and Janet Davidson (VP Quality Assurance and Customer Care, Alcatel-Lucent), asked Vizone Ltd to carry out a short independent review (Healthcheck) of the Alaska Programme. This was administered by Vodafone and commenced on 4th December 2009 with the final Healthcheck report being presented to Alcatel Lucent and Vodafone on the 18th December 2009. The Healthcheck report contained 18 conclusions and 16 recommendations to recover the programme around the issues of &ldquo;plan do ability&rdquo; and &ldquo;capability to deliver&rdquo;.
